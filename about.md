I'm a biologist with interest in evolutionary biology and data science. I got my B.A. in Biology at University of Sao Paulo (USP), and I am currently a Master's student in the Department of Genetics and Evolutionary Biology (also at USP). I have broad interest in evolutionary biology, but I am currently working on contemporary selection in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>'s immune system. In the past, I've worked with molecular phylogenetics of stingray tapeworms.
