Hi, everyone!

Welcome to my personal webpage/blog :)

This page is going to be used to accomplish three main purposes:

* Share with you some things I've learnt in the last couple years about bioinformatics/data analysis/statistics in the form of tutorials
* Get experience with english writing by writing articles/books reviews
* Expose myself as a professional scientist

If you want to find out more about me, please check the <a href="mufernando.github.io/about/">About</a> session. Ah, and feel free to contact me with questions or suggestions by e-mail: <a href="mailto:murillofer.rodrigues@gmail.com">murillofer_rodrigues(at)gmail.com</a>.
