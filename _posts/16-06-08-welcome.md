Hi, everyone!

Welcome to my personal webpage/blog :)

I decided to create this webpage/blog, but I'm still not sure what I'm going to use the blog for. I thought of three main purposes for this blog:

* Share with you some things I've learned in the last couple years about bioinformatics/data analysis/statistics in the form of tutorials
* Get experience in English writing by writing articles/books reviews
* Show my work as a professional scientist

If you want to find out more about me, please check the [About](http://mufernando.github.io/about/) session. Ah, and feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions by e-mail: <a href="mailto:murillofer.rodrigues@gmail.com">murillofer.rodrigues(at)gmail.com</a>.
